This is the POWERPC ArchC functional model.

This model has the system call emulation functions implemented,
so it is a good idea to turn on the ABI option.

To use acsim, the interpreted simulator:

    acsim powerpc.ac -abi               (create the simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc              (compile)
    powerpc.x --load=<file-path> [args] (run an application)

To use accsim, the compiled simulator:

    accsim powerpc.ac -abi <file-path>  (create specialized simulator)
    make -f Makefile.archc              (compile)
    powerpc.x [args]                    (run the application)

The [args] are optional arguments for the application.

There are two formats recognized for application <file-path>:
- ELF binary matching ArchC specifications
- hexadecimal text file for ArchC
